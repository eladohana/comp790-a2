    <h1>US House of Representatives Representation of voters</h1>
    <h2>Premise:</h2>
    <p>U.S. Elections are based on a winner-take-all system where members of the House of Representatives are selected by districts divided along geographical lines.</p>
    <p>Each district selects from a pool of candidates, where the one with the most votes is chosen to represent that district.</p>
    <p>This setup, however, could lead to scenarios where voters are not well represented. </p> 
    <p>For instance, consider that a candidate can win their district with over 50% of the votes in their district.  Now, consider the extreme, though unlikely, scenario where 51% of districts elect candidates from a single party, each winning with 51% of the votes, and that all other voters choose the opposing party.  This now leads the majority party to have won with only about 26% of the votes!</p>
    <p>While this scenario is very improbable, it is important to ask how well do members of congress represent their constituents?</p>

    author = {MIT Election Data and Science Lab},
    publisher = {Harvard Dataverse},
    title = {{U.S. House 1976–2022}},
    UNF = {UNF:6:A6RSZvlhh8eRZ4+mvT/HRQ==},

    }
                
        </listing>
    
        <p>In all datasets, the data was modified to remove special elections and elections superceded by runoffs to avoid over-representing any state.</p>
        <p>With the exception of the last graphics, only Democrat and Republican parties are included, since other parties do not have significant representation, either in representatives or voters.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Representation by state</h2>
    
    <div >
        <p>The graphic below shows congressional maps of the contiguous states based on party leaning from 1980, 2000, and 2020. </p>
        <p>It was created using <strong>Tableau</strong>.</p>
        <div id="congressional_maps">
            <img src="map3.png" alt="Map of the United States colored based on congressional party leanings">
        </div>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>While the maps are useful to see the leanings based on geographic locations, it would be very difficult to clearly show more data.</p>
        <p>To address this, we created a table for each state at every election cycle from 1976–2022</p>
        <p>The following attributes:</p>
        <p>color: Democrat (blue), Republican (red)</p>
        <p>size: voter alignment with representatives (bigger means voters and representatives match more closely)</p>
        <p>mouse-over tooltip: State (year), congressional party lean (total members), percentage voter lean.</p>
        <p>This was created using <strong>d3</strong></p>
        <div id="combined_timeline"></div>
        <p>We tend to see that states with less members tend to be less well-represented.  This is expected since any shift in elected representatives will have a high impact on the percentage.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>National Results</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Finally, we look at combined candidates and voters throughout the country to see if state inconsistencies are averaged out.</p>
        <p>The graphic below shows a percentage stack of congressional winners and the voters for all parties from 1976 to 2022. </p>
        <p>The charts were created in <strong>altair</strong></p>
        <div id="win_timeline"></div>
        <div id="vote_timeline"></div>
        <p>Here we tend to see that voters have mostly stayed in the middle, where congressional makeup has mostly followed, with slightly larger spikes at certain times.</p>
        <p>A possible conclusion could be that while local results may sometimes be skewed, on a national level, congress tends to stay close to voter makeup despite the possibility of edge cases that the system may allow.</p>
